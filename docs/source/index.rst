Welcome to ElfinGuard's documentation!
===================================

ElfinGuard protocols aim to decentralize the web. Its first released protocol, the Access-Control protocol, is designed for the authors and their target audience. The authors use smart contract to program who can and how to access the contents, and CDN providers build neutral channels, through which mass multimedia content can be delivered smoothly from the authors to the target audience. It links the authors and audience directly and frictionlessly, without any intervention or censorship.

No access control, no ownership. In the Web3.0 era, ElfinGuard's Access-Control Protocol is an important infrastructure to bring data ownership back to the creators and users.

.. note::

   The ElfinGuard protocols are still under active development. The documentation here is not stale now.
